==Testing the importer and exporter==
In the early stages, we can test the BSP tree generator by importing an existing POF file and exporting just a single submodel from it, then opening the resultant POF file in PCS or ModelView32.

Additional tests should include making sure calculated stuff equals actual values.  For example, `HeaderChunk.length` should ideally equal the length of the data passed when instantiating the class when reading from a POF file.

==Vertex normals==
Calculating vertex normals can only be done with an edge object with the boolean attribute `seam` or something similar to mark smoothgroups.  Something like:

{{{
class Model:
    vertices = list()
    edges = list()
    faces = list()
    class Vertex:
        coords = vector()
        normals = list()
    class Edge:
        vertices = list() #size=2
        seam = True
    class Face:
        edges = list()
        # __init__() function checks to make sure edges connect
        normal = vector()
    def make_vert_list()
    def make_face_list()
    def calculate_normals()
}}}

In this example, `Model` should be the main class we're working with, only creating `Vertex`, `Edge`, and `Face` objects to add them to a `Model` object as in `Model.vertices.append(Vertex(coords))`.
