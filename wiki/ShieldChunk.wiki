==Attributes==

 * *vert_list* - A list of vectors indicating the coordinates of each vertex.  (A vector is a tuple of three floats representing x, y, and z.)
 * *face_normals* - A list of vectors indicating the normal of each face.
 * *face_list* - A list of tuples representing the vertices of each face, indexed into *vert_list*.
 * *face_neighbors* - A list of lists indexing which faces are each face's neighbors.  This is used in the game for calculating shield quadrants.

==Methods==

 * _read_chunk(self, bin_data)_ - Reads packed binary data to create the instance attributes.
  * *bin_data* - A RawData or File object containing the packed binary chunk, excluding header.
 * _write_chunk(self)_ - Reads the instance attributes and returns a bytes object representing the packed binary chunk, including header.
 * _get_mesh(self)_ - Reads the instance attributes and returns a Mesh object representing the shield mesh.
 * _set_mesh(self, m)_ - Reads a mesh object to create the instance attributes.
  * *m* - A Mesh object containing the shield mesh.
