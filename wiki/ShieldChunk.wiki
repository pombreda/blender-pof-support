==Attributes==

 * _vert_list_ - A list of vectors indicating the coordinates of each vertex.  (A vector is a tuple of three floats representing x, y, and z.)
 * _face_normals_ - A list of vectors indicating the normal of each face.
 * _face_list_ - A list of tuples representing the vertices of each face, indexed into _vert_list_.
 * _face_neighbors_ - A list of lists indexing which faces are each face's neighbors.  This is used in the game for calculating shield quadrants.

==Methods==

 * *read_chunk(self, bin_data)* - Reads packed binary data to create the instance attributes.
  * _bin_data_ - A RawData or File object containing the packed binary chunk, excluding header.
 * *write_chunk(self)* - Reads the instance attributes and returns a bytes object representing the packed binary chunk, including header.
 * *get_mesh(self)* - Reads the instance attributes and returns a Mesh object representing the shield mesh.
 * *set_mesh(self, m)* - Reads a mesh object to create the instance attributes.
  * _m_ - A Mesh object containing the shield mesh.
