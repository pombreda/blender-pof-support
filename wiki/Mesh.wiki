#summary Documentation for the volition.pof.Mesh class
#labels Phase-Implementation
This class is essentially just a container for the _vert_list_, _edge_list_, and _face_list_ attributes--each of which is a sequence of their respective types.  It also provides methods to create those sequences from sequences of various other formats.

==Class methods==
 * *set_vert_list*_(vert_list[, vert_norms=False])_ - Creates a set of Vertex objects from a list of vertices where each vertex is a vector (a sequence of three floats), and optionally a list of vertex normals.
 * *get_vert_list*_()_ - Returns a list of vertices where each vertex is a vector.
 * *set_edge_list*_(edge_list)_ - Creates a set of Edge objects from a list of edges, where each edge in the list is a sequence of two vertex indices and a boolean _sharp_ value.
 * *get_edge_list*_()_ - Returns a list of edges in the same format as is passed to *set_edge_list*.
 * *set_face_list*_(face_list[, by_edges=False])_ - Creates a set of Face objects from a list of faces, where each face is either a sequence of vertex indices or a sequence of edge indices, according to the value of _by_edges_.
 * *get_face_list*_([by_edges=False])_ - Returns a list of faces in the same format as is passed to *set_face_list*.
