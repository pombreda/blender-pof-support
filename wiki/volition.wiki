=Introduction=

This Python module provides various classes and methods useful for handling POF files.  A POF file is read by calling `read_pof(file)`.  As the function iterates through the file, it creates an object for each chunk.  Each chunk's constructor reads in raw binary data and fills out useful variables, such as `DockPointChunk.num_docks`.  The function returns a list of chunks that another function can iterate through to perform various operations with the data.

A POF file is written in a similar manner.  The `write_pof(list)` function takes a list of chunks and produces raw binary data which can be written in a file or further processed.

Reading a chunk goes like this:
 # A chunk is created with `this_chunk = DockPointChunk()`
  * A chunk can be also instantiated by passing the chunk's variables to the constructor, which can be used when writing chunks.
 # `this_chunk.read(raw_chunk_data)` is called.
 # The function reads through the raw data and assigns data to variables.

=Outline of classes and functions=

 * Exceptions
  * FileFormatError(StandardError) - Some part of the file being read or written indicates this is not, in fact, a POF file.
  * InvalidChunkError(StandardError) - Some part of this chunk is borked so the chunk can't be read or written.
  * InvalidBSPError(StandardError) - Some part of the BSP tree is borked so it can't be read or written.
  * VertListError(StandardError) - Some part of the vertex list is borked so a BSP tree can't be created.
  * FaceListError(StandardError) - Some part of the face list is borked so a BSP tree can't be created.
  * GeometryError(StandardError) - Some part of the geometry is borked, or the vertex list doesn't match the face list.  Either way, a BSP tree can't be created.

==SubmodelChunk==
This class has four methods in addition to `read()`, `write()`, `__init__()`, `__len__()`, and `__repr__()`.  Upon calling `read()`, the BSP data is parsed into a list of BSP blocks `self.bsp_data`.  Upon calling `write()`, `self.bsp_data` is parsed into a packed BSP tree along with the rest of the chunk.

 * `get_vert_list()` reads through `self.bsp_data` and stores `self.vert_list` as a list of `Vertex` objects.  Returns true if successful, raises `InvalidBSPError` if unsuccessful.
 * `get_face_list()` like `get_vert_list()`, but with faces.
 * `make_bsp_tree()` creates a list of BSP blocks `self.bsp_data` using `self.vert_list` and `self.face_list`.  Returns true if successful, raises various exceptions if unsuccessful, depending on the problem.
