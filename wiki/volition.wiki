This Python module provides various classes and methods useful for handling POF files.  A POF file is read by calling `read_pof(file)`.  As the function iterates through the file, it creates an object for each chunk.  Each chunk's constructor reads in raw binary data and fills out useful variables, such as `DockPointChunk.num_docks`.  The function returns a list of chunks that another function can iterate through to perform various operations with the data.

A POF file is written in a similar manner.  The `write_pof(list)` function takes a list of chunks and produces raw binary data which can be written in a file or further processed.

Reading a chunk goes like this:
 # A chunk is created with `this_chunk = DockPointChunk()`
  * A chunk can be also instantiated by passing the chunk's variables to the constructor, which can be used when writing chunks.
 # `this_chunk.read(raw_chunk_data)` is called.
